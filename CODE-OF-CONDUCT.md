# Code of Conduct and Project Values

This document outlines the vision, values, and code of conduct that guide ***RaceStORM*** from its inception. It serves as a foundation for building a collaborative and innovative community.

## Project Scope
***RaceStORM*** was born from a love for the strategy that underpins Formula 1, a discipline that continues to grow and makes motorsport truly unique. The key lies in the absence of a single winning strategy. Instead, there is a fascinating risk-reward duality where teams must make data-driven decisions to maximize rewards under ever-changing circumstances.

This project aims to develop a suite of tools that empower anyone to take motorsport strategy to the next level through collaborative development. This approach not only improves existing resources for teams but also enables all contributors to learn and grow along the way.

While the initial focus is on Formula 1, a sport that has been a personal passion for many years, the toolset is designed to be valuable across all motorsport categories where strategy plays a crucial role. ***RaceStORM*** is, therefore, a home for all motorsport enthusiasts.

## Core Values
To foster an environment of collaboration and innovation, we adhere to the following principles:
1. **Passion for Learning**: Everyone in this community has the opportunity to grow and expand their knowledge.
2. **Collaboration**: Open communication and teamwork drive better results and foster innovation.
3. **Inclusivity**: This is a welcoming space for people of all backgrounds, experiences, and expertise.
4. **Transparency**: Decisions and developments are made openly to ensure trust and alignment within the community.
5. **Quality and Impact**: Every contribution, big or small, helps improve the project and its tools.

## Code of Conduct
As an open-source project, ***RaceStORM*** thrives on the idea that everyone can learn from each other. To maintain a constructive and respectful environment, we expect the following behaviors:
- **Respect others**: Treat all contributors with courtesy, even when opinions differ.
- **Be constructive**: Provide thoughtful feedback and avoid criticism that is not actionable or helpful.
- **Stay inclusive**: Create an environment where everyone feels valued and can contribute meaningfully.
- **Avoid disruptive behavior**: Refrain from actions that could hinder progress or the well-being of the community.
