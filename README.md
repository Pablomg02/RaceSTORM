# Race Strategy Optimizer

**Race Strategy Optimizer** is an open-source project under development, designed to determine the optimal strategies for a race **based on event probabilities**, including:

- **Lap Time** influenced by tire degradation and driver consistency  
- **Safety Car Events**  
- **Weather Conditions**  
- **Pit Stop Duration**  

## Features

To provide accurate and consistent results, various elements are modeled, such as:  

- **Tire Behavior**  
- **Overtaking Dynamics**  
- **Pit Stop Strategies**  
- **Car Performance in Different Weather Conditions**  
- **Rival Strategies and Behavior**  

## Key Components  

The project leverages advanced techniques to ensure robust and computationally efficient results:  

- **Monte Carlo Analysis**  
- **Heuristic Optimization**  
- **Data Fitting and Modeling**  

## Get Involved  

The project is still under active development. If you're interested in collaborating or using this project in your own work, feel free to reach out to me:
