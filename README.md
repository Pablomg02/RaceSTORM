# ***RaceStORM*** 
***RaceStORM (Race Strategy Optimization and Risk Management***) is an open-source project under development that aims to provide a framework for teams and Motorsport enthusiasts to determine optimal race strategies, manage risks, and gain valuable insights by leveraging event probabilities and real data.
Some of the key features are:

- **Lap Time** influenced by tire degradation and driver consistency  
- **Safety Car Events**  
- **Weather Conditions**  
- **Pit Stop Duration**

The main objective of the project is to provide a framework to teams and Motorsport lovers where obtaining **optimal strategies, risk management and other insights**.

> ⚠️ ***DEVELOPMENT NOTE*** ⚠️
