***RaceStORM (Race Strategy Optimization and Risk Management***) is an open-source project under development that aims to provide a framework for teams and Motorsport enthusiasts to determine optimal race strategies, manage risks, and gain valuable insights by leveraging event probabilities and real data.
Some of the key features are:

- **Lap Time** influenced by tire degradation and driver consistency  
- **Safety Car Events**  
- **Weather Conditions**  
- **Pit Stop Duration**

The main objective of the project is to provide a framework to teams and Motorsport lovers where obtaining **optimal strategies, risk management and other insights**.



## Features

To provide accurate and consistent results, various elements are modeled, such as:  

- **Tire Behavior**  
- **Overtaking Dynamics**  
- **Pit Stop Strategies**  
- **Car Performance in Different Weather Conditions**  
- **Rival Strategies and Behavior**  

## Key Components  

The project leverages advanced techniques to ensure robust and computationally efficient results:  

- **Monte Carlo Analysis**  
- **Heuristic Optimization**  
- **Data Fitting and Modeling**
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning**
